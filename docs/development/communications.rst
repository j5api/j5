Communications
==============

Most of the communications for `j5` occur on GitHub, but there are a few other comms channels that we also make use of.
This page explains what we use each platform for.

GitHub
------

GitHub is a code hosting and project collaboration platform. We use it to track issues and changes for the project, in
addition to hosting our code repositories.

We have a `GitHub organisation`_ which groups all of our repositories together.

.. _`GitHub organisation`: https://github.com/j5api/

Mailing List
------------

The mailing list is used for communications that need to be properly discussed, such as major changes to the API, or
a change in the project specifications.

Any meetings that occur are also announced on the mailing list.

Our mailing list is hosted on `Google Groups`_. You need to be a member of the list to post to it.

.. _`Google Groups`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/j5api

Slack
-----

We also have casual discussion in ``#j5`` on the `SRO Slack`_.

You can automatically join with a ``@soton.ac.uk`` email address. If you are not a member of the University of
Southampton, please ask for an invite via GitHub or the mailing list.

Meetings
--------

We will have infrequent meetings to discuss the state of the project. These will be announced via the mailing list.

There is usually a canonical physical location, but most will join using Google Meet. Any details of meetings will be
shared in the announcement email.
