Welcome to j5's documentation!
==============================

.. Attention:: This project is currently under heavy development and should not be considered stable.

What is j5?
-----------

`j5` is a unified robotics library that aims to create a single API for controlling robots. It was originally designed to combine the codebases of `Student Robotics`_, SourceBots_ and Robocon_.

Please note that this documentation is not aimed at the average competitor. It is for used by developers of the API, competition volunteers and more advanced students wishing to extend on our API for their robots. Support is discretionary to the individual competition. `j5` will not provide direct support to compeititors at the time of writing.
