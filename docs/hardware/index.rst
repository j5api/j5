Supported Hardware
==================

`j5` is designed to support hardware from many different competitions, some of which are officially supported by the
project.

.. Note:: Currently, these are integrated into the main ``j5`` module, but in the future they are due to be separated
   separate python modules and uploaded to PyPI separately. This ensures that the core of `j5` stays small.
