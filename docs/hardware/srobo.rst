Student Robotics
================

.. Note:: Please note that Student Robotics does not officially endorse `j5`, although we hope they will in the future.

`Student Robotics`_ challenges teams of 16 to 18 year-olds to design, build and develop autonomous robots to compete in
their annual competition. After announcing the year's game, they give teams six months to engineer their creations.
They mentor teams throughout this time, as well as supply them with a kit which provides a framework they can build
their robot around.

Student Robotics is currently on it's fourth generation of robotics kit, which is mostly based around the `ODROID U3`_
and some custom designed hardware that's based on STM32 microcontrollers. The kit communicates with the ODROID using
USB, which has proven to be a more reliable communication method than their previous kits.

``j5`` supports the following Student Robotics Hardware:

- `Power Board v4`_
- `Motor Board v4`_
- `Servo Board v4`_

Support for the Ruggeduino_ is planned.
